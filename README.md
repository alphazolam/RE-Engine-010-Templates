# RE Engine 010 Templates

This is a repository of [010 Editor](https://sweetscape.com) templates for parsing RE Engine game formats.

Many of the templates work arcross all game versions (with the exception of 2017 RE7), but your mileage may vary as I don't regularly update the lesser-used ones unless I need to.
Check out my other templates [REE Chain](https://github.com/alphazolam/REE_Chain-Template) and [RE_RSZ](https://github.com/alphazolam/RE_RSZ), which have their own repositories
